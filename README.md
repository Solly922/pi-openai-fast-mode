## Features

- Registers `/fast [on|off|toggle]`.
- Registers `--fast` to enable Fast Mode at startup.
- Injects `service_tier: "priority"` into matching OpenAI/OpenAI-Codex provider payloads.
- Shows a compact right-aligned TUI `fast` indicator only when enabled and the current model is configured.
- Persists state in user or project scope depending on how the package is loaded.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-openai-fast-mode
# or project-local
pi install -l npm:pi-openai-fast-mode
```

For local development:

```bash
pi -e ./src/index.ts
```

## Usage

```text
/fast          # toggle
/fast toggle   # toggle
/fast on       # enable
/fast off      # disable
```

Start Pi with Fast Mode enabled and persisted:

```bash
pi --fast
```

## Default configuration

Fast Mode starts disabled and applies to OpenAI GPT model IDs version 5.4 or newer. The version rule includes named variants such as `gpt-6-luna` and `gpt-6-sol`, preview or dated variants, and future numbered GPT versions without requiring an extension update. It applies to the `openai` and `openai-codex` providers.

```json
{
  "enabled": false,
  "targets": [
    { "provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-5.4+", "serviceTier": "priority" },
    { "provider": "openai-codex", "model": "gpt-5.4+", "serviceTier": "priority" }
  ]
}
```

The `+` suffix denotes a GPT model version range: `gpt-5.4+` matches version 5.4 and later, including model-name suffixes. Targets always come from the installed package, so saved targets are ignored on load and upgrades apply automatically. The config file is only written when Fast Mode is turned on or off with `/fast` or `--fast`, so Pi subagents sharing the file cannot undo a toggle.

User-scoped state is stored under `~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-openai-fast-mode/config.json`.
Project-scoped state is stored under `./.pi/pi-openai-fast-mode/config.json`.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run check
```
